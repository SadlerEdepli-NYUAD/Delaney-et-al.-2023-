Novel functions of the arsenic Methyl Transferase 3 (as3mt) gene discovered using zebrafish.  RNAseq was performed on zebrafish as3mt mutants in the presenece and absence of inorganic arsenic.  Details in this preprint: [1] Delaney P, Khan N, O’Connor MJ, Ambrosio EM, Garcia-Sabaté A, Teo JC, Pergantis SA, Ober EA, Sadler KC: Arsenite methyltransferase 3 regulates hepatic energy metabolism which dictates the hepatic response to arsenic exposure. bioRxiv 2023:2023.04.05.535637.
